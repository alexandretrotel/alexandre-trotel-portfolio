Zap.ts is my go-to boilerplate for kickstarting a Next.js project, pre-configured with Neon's serverless database and Drizzle as the ORM. It’s all set up and good to go—simply clone the repo and dive into coding. For example, authentication is fully integrated with middlewares in the oRPC backend, delivering type-safe and secure auth out of the box. Plus, there’s an AI Provider Zustand store, letting you effortlessly switch between AI providers in your app via the AI Vercel SDK. The setup is primed for deployment on Vercel or any other serverless platform.
