It is rather difficult to make good prompts to maximize the LLM model's performance. The prompts should be clear, concise, and relevant to the task at hand. The prompts should also be tailored to the specific model you are using. For example, the prompts for GPT-3 are different from those for GPT-2. This project aims to refine prompts easily in a few steps.
